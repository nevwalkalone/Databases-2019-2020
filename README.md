## Description
This repository contains all the projects that were completed for the Databases course of the [Department of Computer Science of the Athens University of Economics and Business](https://www.dept.aueb.gr/el/cs), during the Spring semester of 2019-2020.
A remote database via Amazon AWS was created in order to complete these assignments. Alternatively a local database can be created for these projects to be 
tested. PostgreSQL and pgAdmin were used.
