# Fifth Assignment

More details about this assignment can be found [here](assignment-report/5th-assignment.pdf). **This assignment consists of two parts.**

## Part A

The objective of this part was to normalize our database by creating a new table and deleting some columns. Check [part1.sql](src/part1.sql) for the sql commands that were used.

After these modifications the [ER Diagram](ER-Diagram\airbnb_ERD.png) must be updated and a report named [BCNF.pdf](assignment-report/BCNF.pdf) was written to explain if our database is in BCNF or not.

## Part B

In this part 5 non trivial Join Queries had to be made, which contain Outer Joins, WHERE and GROUP BY statements. Check [part2.sql](src/part2.sql) to get some ideas or to even test them in your database, and then try creating your own queries.
