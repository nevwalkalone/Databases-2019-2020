More details [here](https://github.com/nevwalkalone/PSQL-Projects/blob/main/3rd%20Assignment/assignment/3rd-assignment.pdf).

The objective of this assignment was to create 12 simple queries that include inner and outer joins, where, order
by, limit, min, max, avg, distinct, like, between statements. Check [simple_queries.sql](https://github.com/nevwalkalone/Databases-2019-2020-AUEB/blob/main/3rd%20Assignment/src/simple_queries.sql) to get some ideas or to even test them in your database, and then try creating your own queries.
