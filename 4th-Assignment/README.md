# Fourth Assignment

More details about this assignment can be found [here](https://github.com/nevwalkalone/PSQL-Projects/blob/main/4th-Assignment/assignment/4th-assignment.pdf).

The objective of this assignment was to modify, erase fields and create new tables, in order to normalize the Airbnb schema so the integrity of the data is improved. At this point it is important to note that before any modification of a table **a backup of your Database** is vital. In case something goes wrong you can easily restore the state of your Database by using the backup copy. Check the `/src` folder, to see how all requested modifications were completed.
