# First Assignment

In this assignment an environment setup was requested, therefore the main actions that need to be done are the following:

- **Install PSQL**, after you've downloaded the appropriate exe (if you're on Windows) from the link that was provided in the README file of this repository.
- **Install pgAdmin**, after you've downloaded the appropriate exe (if you're on Windows) from the link that was provided. This will be the graphical user interface for Database handling.
- **Create a database** via pgAdmin or PSQLshell.

Both PSQL and pgAdmin are available for macOs and Linux distributions too.
