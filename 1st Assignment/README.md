# 1st Assignment
In this assignment an environment setup was requested, so the main actions that need to be done are the following:
* **Install PSQL**, after you've downloaded the appropriate exe (if you're on Windows) from the link that was provided in the README file of this repository.
* **Install pgAdmin**, after you've downloaded the appropriate exe (if you're on Windows) from the link that was provided. This will be the graphical user interface for Database handling.
