# 1st Assignment
In this assignment an environment setup was requested, so the main actions that need to be done are the following:
* **Install PSQL**, after you've downloaded the appropriate exe (if you're on Windows) from the link that was provided in the README file of this repository.
* **Install pgAdmin**, after you've downloaded the appropriate exe (if you're on Windows) from the link that was provided. This will be the graphical user interface for Database handling.

Both PSQL and pgAdmin are available for macOs and Linux distributions too.
