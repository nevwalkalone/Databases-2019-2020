# Project

Project assignment in full details can be found [here](assignment-report/project-assignment.pdf).
**This project consists of two parts.**

## Part A

In this part a new database must be created according to this movies [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/176rM0053_QqeTlTuFgtcq4mm-gyiZlha/view). After importing all data into the tables, 4 actions were required:

- Foreign and Primary key constraints for each table
- Deletion of duplicates
- [ER Diagram](partA/ER-Diagram/ERD.png) creation
- [Report](https://github.com/nevwalkalone/PSQL-Projects/blob/main/Final-Project/assignment-report/project-report.pdf) describing all the steps that were followed when processing the data, in order that they get stored in the database correctly

For the data import, deletion of duplicates and Primary-Foreign key constraints check `/partA/partA.sql`.

## Part B

After completing part A, it was requested to calculate some statistics using queries, as well as to visualize them in charts.

Check `/partB/partB.sql` for the queries that were used, and `/statistics` folder which contains visualization for each query.
