# Project

Project assignment in full details can be found [here](https://github.com/nevwalkalone/PSQL-Projects/blob/main/Final-Project/assignment-report/project-assignment.pdf).
**This project consists of two parts.**

## Part A

In this part a new database must be created according to this movies [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/176rM0053_QqeTlTuFgtcq4mm-gyiZlha/view). After importing all data into the tables 4 actions were required:

- Foreign and Primary key constraints for each table,
- Deletion of duplicates,
- [ER Diagram](https://github.com/nevwalkalone/PSQL-Projects/blob/main/Final-Project/partA/ER%20Diagram/ERD.png),
- [Report](https://github.com/nevwalkalone/PSQL-Projects/blob/main/Final-Project/assignment-report/project-report.pdf) describing all the steps that were followed when processing the data, in order they get stored in the database correctly.

For the data import, deletion of duplicates and Primary-Foreign key constraints check [partA.sql](https://github.com/nevwalkalone/PSQL-Projects/blob/main/Final-Project/partA/src/partA.sql).

## Part B

After completing part A, it was requested to calculate some statistics using queries and to visualize them in charts.

Check [partB.sql](https://github.com/nevwalkalone/PSQL-Projects/blob/main/Final-Project/partB/src/partB.sql) for the queries that were used and [statistics](https://github.com/nevwalkalone/PSQL-Projects/tree/main/Final-Project/partB/statistics) folder which contains visualization for each query.
